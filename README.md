# SAROS INTELLIGENCE HUB

Build the future of DeFi with Saros DLMM SDKs — multi‑feature demo, real‑world use cases, and hackathon‑ready architecture. This document captures the complete plan and the “big bow” enhancements we’ll use to stand out. No code changes here; this is a planning and review artifact.

## Bounty Alignment
- Live public demo URL on devnet (mainnet‑ready toggles)
- Open‑source repo with clear README and video walkthrough
- Uses at least one Saros SDK (DLMM strongly preferred)
- Multiple practical features: analytics, advanced orders, automation, bot, simulator

## Big‑Bow Enhancements (Professor‑proof, Builder‑grade)

1) Safety Sim pre‑trade policy (must)
- Simulate every action immediately before broadcast
- Enforce: slippage caps, stale‑slot guard, bin‑shift drift checks, balance deltas, pool‑state invariants
- Block unsafe transactions with human‑readable reasons; never silently continue

2) DLMM‑native advanced orders
- Formalize limit/stop/trailing‑stop via bin placement and timed bin shifts
- Time‑in‑force and cancel‑on‑reorg semantics
- Explicit failure modes and dry‑run previews

3) MEV/latency posture
- Multi‑RPC failover and quorum checks; retry with exponential backoff
- Simulate‑and‑hold under elevated risk; expose an execution‑risk meter
- Jito/MEV notes for future work (no custodial flows)

4) Explainable LP analytics
- PnL, fee APY, IL vs HODL, bin efficiency, rebalance attribution
- CSV export and one‑page PDF summary for judges/users

5) Guardrails (security by default)
- No private keys in Telegram; bot is read‑only + wallet deep‑link actions
- Idempotent actions with client/server nonces
- Per‑action limits: slippage, notional, exposure; pool‑level circuit breakers
- Secrets scanning and dependency risk checks in CI

6) Judge pack (show, don’t tell)
- 2–3 minute demo script; failure‑and‑recovery micro‑demo
- One‑click devnet run, quickstart, faucet link
- Clear limitations and next‑steps noted
